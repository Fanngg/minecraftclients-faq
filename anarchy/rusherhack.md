# Rusherhack \(20$ for normal 100$ for rusherhack+\)

Rusherhack has a variety of bypasses for anarchy servers such as 9b9t, 0b0t, constantiam etc, with plenty of unique features: 

constantiam elytra fly bypass 

boatfly and boatphase 

stashfinder/basefinder\(logs the selected blocks such as shulker boxes, chests etc into a file including the XYZ coordinates of the blocks\) 

rocket elytrafly for 2b2t 

customizable hud 

really good combat modules 

really good support\(the main dev john is very nice, also owns a swag server named oldfag.org\)

There is also a seperate version of rusherhack which is called rusherhack+ which just has more modules. It can be obtained via refferring 5 people to rusherhack which actually buy it, or paying the developer \(john\) 100$. Its just rusherhack, but with more modules.
