# Exhibition

Exhibition is mainly developed by Arithmo. Their website is minesense.pub.

The price for this client is $30 without an invite, however if you know a user with the client and they invite you, you can get it for $20.
Exhibition is a Hypixel-focused client. It is currently one of the oldest Hypixel cheats, however it's bypasses are up there with similar premium clients. It is mostly known for it's skeet clickgui, and it was very popular around 2019. 

The client used to not update as fast as other clients, however the developers have been putting more time to it and the update times have been getting quicker. It usually takes a few days after Watchdog updates for Exhibition to update, however once it updates the client bypasses very well. The bypasses will usually stay until the next "major" Watchdog update.

To purchase Exhibition, you must friend request Arithmo#0031 on discord, and wait for him to accept you. Arithmo gets a lot of direct messages and friend requests, so this might take some time. Once he accepts you, he will determine if you are suitable to purchase the client and will let you purchase it.
