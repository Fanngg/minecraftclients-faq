# Exhibition \(20$ with invite 30$ without\)

Exhibition is a blatant client for 1.8.9 \(however, it does support some other versions of Minecraft through it's version selector\). It is developed by Arithmo and has been around for a few years. It is a Hypixel-focused client, and you have to message Arithmo to apply.

It has periods of time where it doesn't update for a little while, however Arithmo has been updating it more frequently now. It bypasses great after updates, and usually continues to unless there is a major Watchdog update. It's mostly known for it's skeet gui. It has great modules, great visuals, and is comparable to Astolfo and Novoline.

Exhibition is good. However, Arithmo does get a lot of DMs so he usually doesn't accept friend requests for upwards of a few weeks, and it can take a little while to get your payment approved after that. Aside from that, it bypasses great, although updates aren't the most consistent.
