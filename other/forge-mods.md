# Forge Mods \(Non-Cheats\)

## Baritone

Baritone is a pathfinding bot. It can mine, build, farm, do parkour, along with several other features. It is commonly used to travel to specific coordinates or to travel long distances in general. You can get Baritone [here](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone).

## ViaForge

ViaForge is like client sided ViaVersion. It is very useful to use certain clients or mods on servers that might not support that version. You can get ViaForge [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/viaforge).

## Schematica

Schematica can save/load structures and build them \(if you have the materials\). You can download it [here ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/schematica)if you aren't using clients with it, and [here ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/335336049758961666/687308893151690782/Schematica-1.12.2-1.8.0.169-universal_patched.jar)if you are.

## Sodium

Sodium is a widely used alternative for Optifine for fabric. Numbers-wise, it helps more than Optifine. It can be used with Lithium, Hydrogen, and Starlight/Phosphor. Starlight has better performance \(renders lights x25 faster\), but lesser known. It doesn't have shaders. You can get Sodium [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/releases/).

## Hydrogen

Hydrogen is a performance enhancing mod. It is an Optifine alternative. It can be paired with Sodium and its fellows with no issues. Like its fellow mods, it can be used with Meteor and other popular cheat clients. It can be unstable, but it does slightly reduce ram usage. You can get Hydrogen [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/hydrogen-fabric/releases/).

## Lithium

Another Optifine alternative. It can be used with Sodium and its fellows, with no compatibility issues. It helps low-end PCs perform better by optimizing lots of small issues in the Minecraft engine. You can get Lithium [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/releases/).
