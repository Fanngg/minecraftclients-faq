# Liquidbounce

LiquidBounce is a great for a free client, although there are many ups and downs its good overall and can bypass almost any server with the right config. The good things about LB is the incredible customization, it can bypass basically any anti-cheat. Its scripting api allows you to make your own modules and use them from the community. Downsides are mainly how clunky and ugly it is to use making it very user-unfriendly. Overall, since its free you aren't losing much by using it Website: [https://liquidbounce.net/](https://liquidbounce.net/)
