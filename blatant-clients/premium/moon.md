# Moon

Moon is primarily developed by Lennox and Lucky. Their website is [moonclient.xyz](https://moonclient.xyz/).

The price for this client is around $20.

Moon used to go by Moon X, and was a good client for it's time. However, the team at Moon decided to do a full revamp of it, as well as changing the branding from Moon X to Moon. This revamp brought a lot of improvements to the client, as well as making it more well known in the cheating community.

The client's update time is alright, although it could be faster. However, the client's bypasses usually stick around, and there isn't really a time where the client "urgently needs" an update. Sure, Watchdog might get a big update, but you can guarantee some modules on Moon will still be working.

Moon is one of the "best" public clients you can get currently. It's fairly cheap, it has amazing visual settings \(a few different HUDs, colors, even adding things like Jello's keystrokes\), and there's a lot of care put in for the client. While it might be lacking some features, you can know you're in good hands purchasing this client as the Moon development team seems to know what they're doing. There's an update coming out for Moon soon that seems to be promising \(3.1\), and I can only assume it will be bypassing all the way up to the update.
