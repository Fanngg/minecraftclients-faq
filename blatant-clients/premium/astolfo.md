# Astolfo

Astolfo is primarily developed by Zarzel. Their website is [astolfo.lgbt](https://astolfo.lgbt/).

The price for this client is $40, although it can differ depending on what payment method you use.

Astolfo is commonly used on Hypixel, however it does have bypasses for some other servers. The Astolfo team are fairly active when it comes to updates, updating as quick as they can when a new Watchdog update comes out.

Speaking of updates, the client is usually always bypassing. This client is considered the "best" Hypixel cheat on the market \(as of the date this review was created\), and one of the most expensive as well. It has some visual customizability \(hud + gui\), and it's modules also have a lot of settings.

Astolfo also offers a scripting api, ZarScript \([docs](https://github.com/antja03/zarscript-docs)\), which allows users to code modules for the client. There are a lot of modules out there by users, and some that are highly recommended. You can find these \(along with configs for the client\) on the forums.

To purchase Astolfo, you must apply or have an invitation. The application process is fairly simple, as a format is provided, and all you have to do is put in effort and give honest answers.
