Info: Spicy is an open source hacked client that was made for Hypixel, though I'm not 100% sure when development started it is at least 5 months old. The project was posted to github in December of 2020 and receives common updates.

 In the early days the bypasses were mainly aimed at the now closed pvplands, footage of gameplay can be found but there isn't much. 

 The main point of the client was to help others learn about how to use minecraft's source code. The client is made to be an alternative to Sigma and liquidbounce but because it's aimed at Hypixel it doesn't preform well on other servers. 

At its core it uses the same base that is shown in intent.store's tutorial videos but has been heavily modified to have more events and more features. The client uses mcp 918. In the earlier development of the client there were two developers, lavaflowglow and floofy fox but recently floofy fox has left the client for unknown reasons. The SpicyClient servers contain a private backend that has never been leaked or released to the public for security reasons. If you want to recreate the backend for your own purposes then you will need to dig though the source code a bit to find out what its sending since there is no documentation for the api. Some basic info about the api is that its coded in php and uses mysql to save the data. It also blocks vpns from registering and logging in to prevent spam account creation and password cracking.

 In conclusion while spicy is not the best Hypixel client it should be used as a way to learn how to make hacks
