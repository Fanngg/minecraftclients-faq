This client is free.

LiquidBounce is a free open source client made by the CCBlueX Team. Made in March 30th, 2016, this client is one of the most trusted free clients - with no accusations of being a rat/virus. The client is able to bypass on most servers, due to it's scripting capabilities and it's module customizability.

As stated previously, it features custom scripting and HUD, making it versatile among many servers and styles. The client is a forge mod and is made for 1.8 and 1.12, and is compatible with most other forge mods. If you have any questions about the client, are looking for configs/scripts, etc. go to [https://forum.ccbluex.net/](https://forum.ccbluex.net/). If you want to view the source code, you can go to [https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/).

Liquidbounce is a good alternative to some paid clients due to it's scripting capabilities and customizability. The development team is also trusted, and has been around for awhile. If you want to try cheating in Minecraft out, but don't want to commit to purchasing a cheat just yet, you might want to consider using Liquidbounce.
