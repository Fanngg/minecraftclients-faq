# Welcome Page

## Welcome! <a id="welcome"></a>

This Gitbook will provide information and things to know cheating in Minecraft. This could mean ghost clients, blatant clients, utility mods/anarchy clients, clickers, et cetera. While we can't cover every single cheat/client, we hope to provide a good overview of each one that we can provide info for, and some other general information for people that are interested.[
