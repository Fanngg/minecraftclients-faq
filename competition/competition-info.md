# Competition info

Competition for gitbook submissions: requirements: you must have cashapp or a bitcoin wallet to receive money. you do not have to have those to win, but i just kinda dont pay you if you dont. Only submissions that are accepted will be added. Low quality submissions will not be accepted. Submissions containing opinions will not be accepted. 

Prizes:

## \#1 most submissions: 10$ \(cashapp or btc\)

## \#2 most submissions: 5$ \(cashapp or btc\)

## \#3 most submissions: 3$ \(cashapp or btc\)

If you want it in bitcoin, be aware that might not happen immediately, as i am relying on voxel to get bitcoin for me. if anyone else can resell me bitcoin in a more immediate fashion, that would be wonderful. Cashapp will be immediate.

 This competition will go for a month, or until the gitbook is finished. This post was made at 12:00 on march 28th \(2021\), so a month from now will be 12:00 am on april 27th \(2021\). 

By finished we mean there is no page without any content on it \(excluding the old section.\). 

P4 and fang cannot win, fang because he is paying for it and that would be stupid, and p4 because he said he didnt want to and he is doing like 99% of this.
