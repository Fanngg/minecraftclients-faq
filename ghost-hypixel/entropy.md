# Entropy 30$

Pretty decent ghost client. great for the pricepoint. Does not support lunar. Works on 1.8.9. Does support badlion.  Website is entropy.club. Good support, tickets are answered relatively quickly. Updates are pretty common, and come out whenever theres a detection by a big ss tool \(paladin or avenge\). There hasnt been an update for a little while due to how big the next update will be, as it will be entropy v4 and there will be a whole new gui and all that.
