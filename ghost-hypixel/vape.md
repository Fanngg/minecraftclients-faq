# Vape \(9.99$ a month for lite\)

Vape v4: Vape v4 is an internal ghost client. It is developed by Manthe and is a pretty good client if you don't plan on playing on servers that screenshare. It is very feature rich and offers support for some default versions of Minecraft \(1.7.10, 1.8.9, 1.12.2, 1.14.4\), along with other launchers and forge \(it does not support Lunar\).

There's not a lot to say about Vape. It is very good however it lacks severely in screenshare protection. You WILL get caught if you use this on a server that screenshares \(most practice servers do\). However, this client is golden for a server like Hypixel. Hypixel doesn't screenshare, and Vape's ghost modules work excellent on it. Although, a lot of the blatant modules don't bypass as that isn't the "goal" of it.

Vape v4 is a great client IF you play on servers that don't screenshare. It's good for the price and is very feature rich. However, as mentioned previously, the client goes downhill when you add screensharing into the mix. If you play Hypixel only, GET THIS CLIENT.

vape lite : Vape Lite is an internal ghost client. It is developed by Manthe and is considered \(objectively\) one of the best ghost clients on the market, comparable to Whiteout. It officially supports the default versions of Minecraft \(1.7.10, 1.8, 1.8.9, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11, 1.12, 1.14.4 and 1.16\), but it works on other launchers such as Lunar or Badlion, although you might run into some bugs. It has an internal and external gui, along with all the modules commonly found in ghost clients and some you don't usually expect e.g. legit scaffold. It is good for servers that screenshare \(+ servers that don't\) and if you want to be undetected.

A cool feature on Vape Lite is it's external visuals, so if you record on OBS but want to use the Arraylist or ESP you can turn those type of modules on without OBS capturing it.

All in all, Vape Lite is one of the better ghost clients on the market. It's been available for purchase for years, but still gets updated \(to this day\). It has a clean gui, good modules with alright customizability \(as much as you would really need\) and unofficially supports a lot of versions of Minecraft.
