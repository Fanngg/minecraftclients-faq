# Common mistakes when choosing a cheat.

**What do you want?**

If you want to do blatant cheating, then on what server do you want to do it on? If you want to do it on hypixel, then see the hypixel tab, if you want to do it on mineplex, then see the mineplex tab. If you want to do it on hcf servers, then see the hcf tab. Not all cheats can bypass on all servers. Infact its very unlikely that the random hypixel client you have picked will bypass on the server you wanna play.

**Don't choose cheats based off of just what your friend said**

Please do some research before using any one source of information for your purchase. Even this one. You should look further into any client we recommend you, before just buying it. Purchasing things based off of a single persons recommendation is generally a bad idea and will likely leave you with quite a bit of regret.

**Clients aren't magic**

Minecraft itself limits clients, no client can just give you op instantly no virus no scam 100%%!!111. Any client that claims to do that is most likely attempting to scam you / rat you \([Definition of rat](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/what-is-rat/#:~:text=A%20RAT%20or%20remote%20administration,turn%20on%2Foff%20your%20device.)\). Essentially the reason behind these limitations is because some things are client side \(movement, hits, rendering stuff\) and some things are server side \(who is op, what permissions you have, where blocks are\), clients can edit the client side, but for you to be able to edit anything that would be considered server side, you would have to have access to the servers panel. If you have a question on whether or not a module is something thats possible, and it hasnt been mentioned in this paragraph, then you can make a post on the sub about it.

**Don't buy a cheat just because it looks good in montages.**

Sure, its great that it looks nice in a montage, but that's the purpose of a montage, please watch reviews of it before you buy it, and i mean real reviews, not just showcases. Also, keep in mind the date on reviews / montages, if you looked at montages with people using etb, they would look great, but they are all from 2016, and now etb is not a client anyone should buy. 

**Antiviruses flagging it does not necessarily mean its a virus, and antiviruses not flagging it does not necessarily mean its not a virus.**

Its extremely common for clients to flag antiviruses, especially ghost clients, due to ghost clients literally being trojans. They inject into another program's shit, and they try to hide their tracks. Its not only ghost clients either, blatant clients sometimes flag antiviruses, like astolfo.
