# Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a method used by cheat developers to prevent their code from getting stolen. A developer will put their project into an obfuscator, which will then make the code unreadable to a simple Java decompiler. This can cause the cheat to flag as malware, however isn't a sign of it being malware.[
