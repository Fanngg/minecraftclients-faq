# Identification

Identification methods are used in Minecraft cheating to determine if the user that is using the cheat is the one who paid for it. There are many identification methods, the two most popular being HWID and IP - and they allow a way for the cheat to be used only by purchasers of it. A form of identification is included in basically every premium cheat.[
