# HWID

A HWID is a unique identifier generated from your computer, and the parts/hardware it contains. It stands for "hardware ID", and has a chance to change if you change hardware in your machine, or if you update your computer.â€Œ

A HWID may be used as an identification for premium clients, to ensure that the person using the client is the person who bought it. Most clients will use this as a method of identifying the user, and all will NOT use the same method of getting the HWID.[
