# IP Address

An IP Address is an address that identifies your network connection. This address is created by your router, and can be changed if you call your internet provider or, if you have a dynamic IP, you can simply reset your router to change this.â€Œ

Similar to HWID identification, an IP address may also be used in regards to identifying the user that is using a cheat. Clients will rarely use this method of authentication, however it does come up every now and then.[
