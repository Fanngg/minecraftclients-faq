# Blinkfly

Blinkfly is a form of the module "fly" or "flight" that instead of hovering the player to their destination, essentially teleports them there. It feels like a fly clientside, but it's more of a really janky teleport. These, however, are considerably faster compared to ZoomFlies. ZoomFly is the standard form of fly in which the user actually gets levitated by some means to their destination, both serverside and client side.
