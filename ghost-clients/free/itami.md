# Itami

Itami is a free external client made by Saxony. You can download it at [http://itami.cf/](http://itami.cf/).

It features simple modules and GUI, with left and right autoclickers with randomization, randomized reach, a pretty simple velocity module with only one setting for horizontal and vertical knockback, some GUI settings \(color and hide GUI\), and a config system. It can be injected into most popular clients, like Vanilla, Forge, Badlion, and Lunar Clients.

The client is relatively new, but has a pretty big community and trust from many well-known people, for example Nightbot \([http://youtube.com/Nightbot/](http://youtube.com/Nightbot/)\), and has not had any accusations of being malicious.
