# Entropy

Entropy is primarily developed by Fury. Their website is [entropy.club](https://entropy.club).

The price of this client is $30.

Entropy has had quite a rise in popularity. Starting as an okay to decent cheat, it didn't really bring a lot different. However, with Entropy v3, there's been a lot of discussion on if cheats should be lower in price to due something like Entropy bringing you all the features you would need at just $30.

Entropy's update schedule hasn't been that good recently, however the developer has been solely working on the next update to the client, v4. In it's current state, it has a lot to offer for the price. It is an injection client and doesn't have lunar support, however it does have all the modules necessary for ghost cheating. It also has a lot of checks for those modules, so you can safely bypass.

Entropy's price to performance ratio is definitely something to think about when you consider getting this cheat. It has a fairly low price \(for ghost clients\), although it brings everything you would need along with some extra checks and customizability. However, if you would prefer something that updates more frequently, I would consider some of the other ghost clients on our list. While v4 might be incredible, it's taken months and people question if it will ever actually come out.
