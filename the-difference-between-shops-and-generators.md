# The difference between shops and generators

Essentially: On a shop, you will buy an alt and recieve its email and password with which you can use to login. \(The credentials are generally sent to you in the format of email:password; it's useful to know that most clients can parse a lot of accounts given to it in this format so you need not enter every account one by one, but just hit CTRL+V in the client's alt manager.\) 

Generators never give you the email or password, but you \(generally\) get a key or token of some sort used to connect to the generator's own login servers. You can use the account through the token without ever recieving the email/password.

 A few examples of shops would be rebornalts or alts.top, while a couple examples of generators are thealtening and alts.pizza.

If you do blatant cheating frequently \( atleast 2-3 times per week\), or you bot servers, a gen is probably best for you, but if you dont cheat that often, or if you are mostly ghost cheating, you should use a shop.
