# The difference between shops and generators

Essentially: On a shop, you will buy an alt and recieve its email and password with which you can use to login. \(The credentials are generally sent to you in the format of email:password; it's useful to know that most clients can parse a lot of accounts given to it in this format so you need not enter every account one by one, but just hit CTRL+V in the client's alt manager.\) 

Generators never give you the email or password, but you \(generally\) get a key or token of some sort used to connect to the generator's own login servers. You can use the account through the token without ever recieving the email/password.

 A few examples of shops would be rebornalts or alts.top, while a couple examples of generators are thealtening and alts.pizza.

Each category is in order of its reputation. On the sidebar, the most trusted alt shops will be at the top and the least trusted will be at the bottom. None of the shops listed are scams \(as of posting this\) but some shops are ridiculously overpriced.

If you cheat something like EVERY SINGLE DAY and its all blatant, then you should probably get a gen, but if you cheat maybe once or twice a month, you should buy from a shop.
