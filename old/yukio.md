# Yukio \(12.5 for clicker\)

Yukio classic, \(15$ from spezz\): Yukio Classic is an external ghost client. It is developed by rzy and is an okay client for the price. It has the basic modules - reach, velocity, autoclicker, and a few others, along with an external gui \(NOT a webgui\). It is however limited by it being an external client, and at the time of this review \(2/22/2021\) it does not include aim assist. The modules work fine, and it seems to be okay screenshare-wise, however it's just okay. The developer is usually active in the discord server, however a lot of members of the community have varying opinions of him.

Yukio Classic is ok. It's not the best external but it is an alright client if you just want an external. However, there are other options for externals out there that some consider better for the price + there isn't really a good reason to get an external over an internal.
