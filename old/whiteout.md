# Whiteout \(60$ for lifetime\)

Price: $60 \($5 - Week, $10 - Month, $25 - 3 Months\) 

 Whiteout is what is called in the ghost-client community as an internal client. Whiteout features many things that are useful for practice servers as well as Hypixel. Such include bridge-assist and teams mode aim-assist. It is highly customizable and is now considered \(arguably\) one of the best ghost-clients. It supports a variety of clients: Badlion, Lunar \(Not stated on the website\), Forge, CheatBreaker, PvPLounge, and LabyMod. Lunar support is dodgy as is must be re-added by the developers because of how Lunar does things. Note: This is not comprehensive and much more information can be found on Whiteout's website [https://whiteout.lol/](https://whiteout.lol/)
