Decent hypixel client. best option at this price. Updates are relatively rare though, but when they come out it works pretty well. I occasionally use it as a ghost client as it has a .selfdestruct function and decent ghost modules. It also has a scripting api, so you can make your own modules if you need to. It also has superherofx, which makes it just the best client ever.

Do not buy until b21 comes out though, because currently it autobans on hypixel.
