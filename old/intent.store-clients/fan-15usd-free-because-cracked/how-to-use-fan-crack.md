# How to use fan crack

 Tutorial for free Fan client the Hypixel intent client, Version 3.1 built from src leak. 

Step 1 

\(For this tutorial you need Winrar or 7zip google it, its free and useful, you can't extract the folder without them\) 

Download the files 

\(Download link is [https://anonfiles.com/j4F97d01p7/Fan\_rar](https://anonfiles.com/j4F97d01p7/Fan_rar) and libraries folder is [https://anonfiles.com/X3c48f01p4/libraries\_rar](https://anonfiles.com/X3c48f01p4/libraries_rar)\)

 Step 5 

launch minecraft launcher and add new installation and look for the option called fan, if you are on tlauncher it should show it automatically just press the version box and look for fan and press launch game

 Troubleshooting.... If an error somehow happens, use the "libraries" folder included and extract it in .minecraft \(Not versions\), if it says "Overwrite existing" press that and let it overwrite, then try launching again, see if it works, if it did enjoy fan, if not contact Xatz Owner on discord: "Napoleon ZoomberParts\#4218" or u/GreatZardasht on reddit. 

"This is all 100% safe and built from fan src leak by Napoleon, want to build it yourself? Here the sourcecode [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/767017336884428831/788136311868620900/fan\_src.zip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/767017336884428831/788136311868620900/fan_src.zip) I have not obfuscated The "Fan" client I built so that if you feel unsafe you can easily use a decompiler and check for yourself."

* Please do note that this was all written by Napolean himself, and him saying his own thing is 100% safe should not be what you base your trust off of. I would highly reccomend actually reading through it and looking at it, even though i do 100% trust him.
