# Future \(20$\)

  
Future is a public paid client that can be purchased at [https://futureclient.net/](https://futureclient.net/). It costs $20 USD or equivalent in other currencies. Payment is accepted through PayPal or Bitcoin. You can also contact the developers to work out payment through USA google play gift card or CA, USA, DE, or UK Amazon. Future supports versions 1.8.9, 1.12.2, 1.13.2, and 1.14.4. Additionally, 1.8.9 and 1.12.2 support forge so it’s possible to combine future with mods or other clients. Optifine is also supported.

Future features many modules that work on popular anarchy servers as well as less popular minigames servers. Many people use Future as their main client in conjunction with others. The quality of Future’s modules is very high; the autocrystal that was recently updated is especially good. Great visuals and performance – Future will run with little to no hit to performance as compared to standard Minecraft and look good while doing it. Future also includes some exclusive movement bypasses that work great, especially on smaller anarchy servers.

Future lacks some features that other anarchy clients consider standard such as autotrap and anchor. The update pace is also glacial with 2-3 updates per year. Owing to that, Future will likely not be the first client to get new, popular bypasses or dupes. Though it is customizable, some of the options are located in obscure places, have oddly named settings, and settings are only accessible through chat commands.

Future has a few Hypixel bypasses as well as ghost features, but these aren’t the main focus of the client. Good as a main client, but another client installed along Future may be necessary depending on your playstyle and needs.
