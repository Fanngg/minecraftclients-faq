# Rusherhack

Rusherhack is developed by john200410

Client can be purchased for 20$ at rusherhack.org for a lifetime.

Rusherhack has been developed by john200410 for a few years now.

You can purchase Rusherhack+ by referring 5 people to buy the client using the code john will give you \(you will have to dm him for you to get your code though\) OR you can just give him straight 100$.

Rusherhack+ users get beta builds of the client, special cape, 2b2t restart alerts\(useful for skipping queue\) and much more!

Rusherhack has many features for anarchy servers, while the Auto Crystal module is lacking, there are other high quality modules that fill the gap, such as: Elytrafly, Basefinder, Autosurround, Autotrap, IllegalItemDetect, extensive customization of hud elements and more! To receive support, client configurations, instant HWID resets and much more you should visit the official discord which can be accessed in the installer.
