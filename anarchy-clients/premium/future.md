# Future

**Edit: While claims of Future being a rat have come out, there is no solid evidence. If any new info comes to our attention, we will add it to this overview.** [**Here's a reddit post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftclients/comments/meh5gk/why_future_isnt_a_rat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **discussing why it most likely isn't a rat.** 

Future is primarily developed by 0x22. Their website is [futureclient.net](https://futureclient.net).

The price for this client is $20.

Future is one of the most well-known anarchy clients as of this overview. It supports versions 1.8.9, 1.12.2, 1.13.2, and 1.14.4 - and versions 1.8.9 along with 1.12.2 can be used as Forge mods. While Future is targeted towards servers like 2b2t and other popular anarchy servers, it does contain a few modules that might work on some minigames servers. 

Future is commonly used as one's main anarchy client. Future shouldn't affect your performance if you are worried about that, and it has a lot of modules. The modules have a lot of settings, and there is a lot of quality put in the client. While Future does have a lot going for it, it also has some other problems. For example, the update schedule is usually just 1-3 per year. This means that if a popular dupe comes out, a popular bypass or a new popular module is developed, Future might not get it for a little while.

While Future does have a lot of features and quality, depending on the user's playstyle a secondary client might be needed \(i.e. Konas for crystal pvp\). However, on it's own, Future definitely holds up to other Anarchy Clients such as Rusherhack, and is definitely a client you should consider.
