Info and history: Konas is a cpvp client for 1.12. It has a crystal aura which is known for its speed, versatile offhand modules, and working bypasses on a variety of servers. It has a packetfly that works on many servers as well. It is a pvp-focused client, not for utility. It is also notable that it is cheaper than other clients, costing $5 less than normal. It used to be private, but went public and quickly rose to fame. A notable module is rubberfill, which fills your own hole with obsidian to prevent others from hopping in. It includes all the normal combat modules, like crystal aura, killaura, autotrap, holefill and webfill. Its offhand module works with crystal aura, as with many other clients. It also has several bypassing movement modules, like step, reverse step, anchor, timer, and speed. For visuals, it has a customizable viewmodelchanger, esp, and chams. Miscellaneous modules include packetmine and smartwalk, which is an autowalk with baritone guiding you around obstacles.

Issues include no compatibility with Phobos, and not a lot of utility. Because it is usable with most other mods, that is not an issue. It is not a client for beginners. That is due to the fact that it is so customizable, it can be easy to configure wrong if you don't know what you're doing.

Highlights include a customizable crystal aura, efficient autototem, customizable offhand module, and the unique module rubberfill.
