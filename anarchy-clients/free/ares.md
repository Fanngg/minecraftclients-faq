Info and history: Having a 1.12 forge version, 1.16 forge version, and 1.16 fabric version, Ares is a very versatile client. On 1.16, it is compatible with Meteor client, a common combo.

It also has a csgo-like clickgui, as well as a standard one.

Issues include lack of bypassing modules.

Highlights include a speedy crystal aura and compatibility with other clients. Its crystal aura with Meteor is a common combo.
