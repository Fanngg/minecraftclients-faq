# Xulu

Xulu was cracked by Elementars. GitHub: [https://github.com/Elementars/Xulu-v1.5.2](https://github.com/Elementars/Xulu-v1.5.2).

Price: It was a leaked client that was cracked. Free.

Info and history: It was a private client, and then leaked. Elementars got the jar, decompiled and deobfuscated it, and then released the jar and source code to the public. It is not malware, which is uncommon for leaked clients. It is a customizable secondary client, but not commonly used as a main client due to how it lacks in modules for pvp. The default clickgui button is Y, if that doesn't work do .bind clickgui y and then it will be bound. A notable module is fastfall, which automatically makes you fall at terminal velocity. That can sometimes cause issues with reverse step, however.

Issues include few combat modules, therefore making it an uncommon choice for a main client.

Highlights include a strafe that bypasses many servers anticheats and autowither, a somewhat rare module for a free client.
