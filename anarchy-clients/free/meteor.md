# Meteor

Meteor is developed by Minegame. Github: [https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client).

Price: Free and open sourced.

Info and history: Meteor is popular 1.16 client for anarchy servers. Due to the fact that most anarchy clients are on 1.12, this makes meteor very unique. It has a lot of utility modules, such as a stashfinder, autoshear, autobrewer, echest farmer, and packet mine to name a few. It can be paired with other clients like Ares for a maximum efficiency combo. As with most 1.16 mods and unlike 1.12 mods, it runs on fabric.

Issues include a slower crystal aura compared to other clients. The module names are strange compared to other clients, sometimes making it difficult to find what you need.

Highlights include bypassing speed and offhand that works with crystal auras for different clients.
