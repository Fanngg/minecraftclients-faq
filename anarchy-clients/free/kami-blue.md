# Kami Blue

Kami Blue is/was developed by 086/l1ving/iBuyMountainDew. There website is [https://kamiblue.org](https://kamiblue.org).

This client is free.

Kami Blue is an anarchy utility client originally known for its crystal aura, which is fast, but its placement is often inaccurate. Due to this, it is often used with another client \(W+2, phobos, etc\) that has better cpvp. KAMI Blue was built on KAMI, made by 086. KAMI Blue was started in 2018, with l1ving taking over for half a year in 2019, and then iBuyMountainDew taking over after that. Currently according to it's GitHub page, iBuyMountainDew and l1ving are the current main devs for the client. 

It has an abnormal gui keybind \(y\) making it easier for it to be used alongside other clients. It is currently used with Forge, with plans being made to port it to Fabric. It has built-in Baritone, using the ;b prefix. All in all, a very solid utility client that is lacking some areas, but arguably makes up for it with a fast crystalaura, along with miscellaneous cheats that many clients lack such as HoleSnap and AutoSpawner.
