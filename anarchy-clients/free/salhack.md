# Salhack

Salhack was primarily developed by Ionar2. The website is [https://salhack.com/](https://salhack.com/). The client can be be downloaded for free on GitHub.

Salhack is a client made for 2b2t and other anarchy servers. It supports Minecraft version 1.12.2. Salhack is usually used as a main client and may be used with a secondary client for CrystalPVP if needed.

Salhack is currently not maintained as ionar has made the decision to leave the project, however there are forks of it which are still being maintained \(e.g. Creepy Salhack by CreepyOrb924 [https://github.com/CreepyOrb924/creepy-salhack](https://github.com/CreepyOrb924/creepy-salhack)\)
