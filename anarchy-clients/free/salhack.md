Pyro no longer has a site \( probably taken down \) any attempt in buying is not advised bc there are cracks and u'll probably get scammed if u try to buy it

All the "versions" are free and open source except Pyro.

Salhack is a utility mod for 1.12.2 anarchy with multiple versions/skids. Normal Salhack is pretty straight forward, having all the anarchy modules you might want for cpvp or exploring 2b and clones. the ca is kinda bad but some modules like surround rival even the most modern clients. The hud editor is very customizable and has many.

SalHackSkid has pretty much nothing added besides popbob sex dupe and other useless shit so you are better off using other versions.

Creepy Salhack is one of the best versions of Salhack and only lacks Superherofx. The modules added are: 

Deleted modules: Reach; Swing; RetardChat; 

Test modules: offhand and more shit 

Added modules: Cool Main Menu; dupe and autodupe; highway builder and much more 

Creepy Salhack is as said one of the more worked on versions of the already good client Salhack is and is the version you should use.

Summit is basically the same as normal Salhack with the only notable exception of having Superherofx and a better ca.
