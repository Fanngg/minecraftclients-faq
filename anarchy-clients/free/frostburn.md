# Frostburn

Name: Frostburn Developed by: Evaan GitHub Source: [https://github.com/evaan/FrostBurn](https://github.com/evaan/FrostBurn)

Price: Free and open source

Info and history: Being a new client, it is not unfair to not trust it. However, because it is open source, you can check it for malware yourself. It is for fabric 1.16. It lacks modules such as crystal aura, a clickgui, or autoanchor. Because of that, you may want to reconsider using this as a main pvp client. It has an offhand module with offhand crystal and a setting to swap to a totem when low on health or falling. It is compatible with meteor, ares, sodium and similar mods, and many more. Its main appeal is autostaircase, which automatically builds a staircase for creating lavacasts. Instead of using scaffold for it, it uses a mechanic called airplace which allows it to use half as many blocks for creating the staircase, and also being faster and more consistent than a human using scaffold.

Issues: Lack of render and combat features, and render modules such as esp or chams.

Highlights: An offhand module that can trigger an offhand totem while falling a far distance. A client for fabric 1.16. Unique autostaircase module, for making lavacasts.
