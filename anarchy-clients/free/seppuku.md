# Seppuku

Seppuku is developed by the team at [https://seppuku.pw/](https://seppuku.pw/).

Seppuku client is an open source anarchy client for 1.12.2, especially suited towards 9b9t. It is developed by a number of contributors, and you can find showcases and downloads on their official website \(linked above\) and on the GitHub repository [https://github.com/seppukudevelopment/seppuku](https://github.com/seppukudevelopment/seppuku)

This client has been in development for a few years now, and is primarily focused on modules that are useful for 9b9t.org. It features a clean, useable GUI and HUD menu along with tons of modules that bypass NCP and work extremely well. Some modules, most notably the CrystalAura is not the best compared to other clients, but these are always being changed and improved. It has some unique HUD elements such as OverView and RearView, which display what your player can see from behind them. There is also an external plugin API, which allows users to add modules or features to the client in an easy to use system. The client also supports macros and keybindings for your ease of use.
